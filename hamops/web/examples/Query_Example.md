## 🧠 Claude's Intelligent Workflow

**What Made This Possible:**
1. **Natural Language Understanding**: Claude interpreted the complex expedition planning request
2. **Intelligent API Orchestration**: Automatically determined which endpoints to call and in what order
3. **Data Synthesis**: Combined results from multiple APIs into coherent analysis
4. **Domain Expertise**: Applied amateur radio knowledge to interpret technical data
5. **Adaptive Problem Solving**: When weather station lookups failed, pivoted to systematic CWOP pattern discovery

**Key Workflow Decisions Claude Made:**
- Started with frequency/band analysis to establish legal operations
- Verified station infrastructure before planning routes  
- Used systematic search patterns when direct lookups failed
- Prioritized high-confidence data sources (W1AW, band plans)
- Generated weather timeline from discovered active stations
- Provided backup communication strategies based on propagation analysis

This demonstrates how AI can transform complex technical APIs into accessible planning tools for amateur radio operators.
